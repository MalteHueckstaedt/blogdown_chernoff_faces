# Individual production

Before studying social sciences, I studied fine arts in Hanover and Berlin. It should be about ten years since I gave up my "_individual production_" in favour of my academic career. Why I gave up my production? The daily practice of art-produktion seemed to me to be too demanding and exhausting to receive little response and, most likely, no money for it.

Despite the fact that I definitely failed early and hard as an artist, I am very grateful for the experiences I was allowed to gain in the art world. What does that mean?
